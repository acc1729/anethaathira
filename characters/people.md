# People of Anethaathira


## Darius

### Region: Placus, Kimnuseia
### Title: Wizard

Darius is a twenty-six year old magician, close friends with Malcolm. Darius has a tall, broad build, with short jet black hair and a rugged complexion. Having learnt as much as he can in the small city of Placus, near the Maple Forest, Darius has set out to explore the world and further empower himself through study and practice. Darius has reservations about Malcolm's power, finding its source to be somewhat disgraceful to the art of magic, but more importantly, very dangerous as well. Darius specializes in Abjuration.

## Jack

### Region: Ultimum Occidens, Ordia
### Title: Eternal King

Jack is a powerful sorceror who ascended to power in Ultimum Occidens. It's said his gaze alone is enough to bend the world to his will. Believing himself to be the true successor of John the Planebinder, he set himself as the monarch of the bridge, causing some conflict with the state of Ordia. None could afford to mount an assault on Ultimum, and Jack's uncontestable power has led to his stable, prosperous rule of the western half of the bridge.

## John

### Region: Anethaathira
### Title: Planebinder

John was the most powerful magician to have ever set foot on Anethaathira. Having lived some two-thousand years ago, the facts about this man have faded into legend, and myth from there. It is said that he created the bridge that spans the world.

## Malcolm

### Region: Placus, Kimnuseia
### Title: Warlock

Malcolm is a 26 year old human male. He is a rather thin man with sun-kissed skin, with a skinny nose and thin lips that match well with the rest of his body composition. His eyes are a deep amber color, and he has light brown hair with streaks of blonde. Typical attire for Malcolm on a daily basis is a black robe lined with bits of yellow design covering up leather armor underneath.

## Thomas

### Region: Kimnuseia
### Title: Assassin

A middle-aged human, roughly forty years old. Graying hair and a lean, trim build behind a jovial, kind hearted smile. Frequently wears a purple cloak with the hood down, accented by a silvery pauldron on the right shoulder. Finds himself in the good graces of the local nobility, where his unique skills afford him a life of travel.
