        "Karst is a war general from a smaller city in Tetaco.",
        "The man is known for his for his tendancy to bury a city at the slightest sign of the presence of abberations, believing there to be an unholy invasion by outer kinds.",
        "Other cities are offered a choice: join his cause voluntary, or be crushed under the weight of his army.",
        "!Karst was contacted by an eldritch being at a young age, seeing the potential in him and wishing to show him the world as it truly was.",
        "!However, Karst was still only a boy, and his adolescent mind could not handle the stress.",

        "!He dedicated himself to eradicating the aberrant and the monstrous.",
        "!In times of great struggle he can bring these visions back to the front of his mind, reliving the trauma in exchange for the ability to see beyong the veil again, allowing him the gift of truesight, and the power to clamp any teleportation near him.",
        "!These moments are scene as furious, psychotic episodes, and his feriocity during them has led to rumors of insanity."
