        "A middle-aged human, roughly forty years old. Graying hair and a lean, trim build behind a jovial, kind hearted smile. Frequently wears a purple cloak with the hood down, accented by a silvery pauldron on the right shoulder. Finds himself in the good graces of the local nobility, where his unique skills afford him a life of travel.",
        "!Thomas's striking efficiency with his craft has earnt him the gaze of several powerful groups of people, as well as Alektrozh herself. In combat, Thomas can invoke a prayer to Alektrozh, binding everyone near him to a promise with her. Breaking the promise causes black flames to wick up and consume those who defile it."
