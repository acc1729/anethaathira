You may discard a known trait when learning a new one.

## Learn

During combat with an enemy, you may attempt to learn a trait from them.
As an action, you attempt to learn the traits of a creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
Make a skill check, whose skill is dependant on the creature's type, and whose DC is dependant on the creature's tier.
On a success, you add the appropriate trait to your traits list.
Once you successfully learn a trait, you must finish a long rest before using this feature again.

You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling

While you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other wapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.

## Spellcasting

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase on ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

# Subclasses

*Thinking maybe three different archetypes.*
*Monster hunter, lore master, and some sort of hippie explorer.*
*I don't particularly care for monster hunter, but David seemed to like it as inspiration.*
*Lore master could get expertise in some intelligence skills, and proficiency with investigation?*
*Hippie explorer can some buff to passive perception, and maybe improved senses.*

# Spell List

To do

# Creature Traits

*Warlock gets 32 invocations to select from. We'll have 4 by 14 for 56, almost double.*
*Plus, the Blue Mage can typically have twice as many traits as a Warlock of equivalent level.*
*It would behoove us to keep Traits short and half as powerful as invocations.*
*All recover on short rest? Long rest? Individual?*

Traits are abilities learnt from other creatures.
You must have the appropriate level in Learn to acquire a trait.
If a trait causes a creature to make a saving throw, the DC is your Spell Save DC.
If a trait allows you to cast a spell, use your Blue Mage Spell Attack Modifier or Spell Save DC.

# Other thoughts?

Still need to come up with great feats for levels 10, 14, and 18.

- Insight vs Intelligence contested check to opportunity attack the Blue Mage
- Can Charm creatures into thinking the Blue Mage is a creature of their type.
- Can communicate with creatures as if the Blue MAge were their type.
- Gets an opportunity attack against any creature that uses a feature (very tricky wording).
- Charm or Frighten monster as an action, Int mod times per day.
