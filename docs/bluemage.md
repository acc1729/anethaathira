## Traits

As part of your understanding of your foes, you may adopt certain traits throughout your travels.
The traits you can learn are detailed in the Traits List at the end of this class description.
You may know a number of traits equal to half your Blue Mage level + your Intelligence modifier.
You may discard a known trait when learning a new one.

## Learn

During combat with an enemy, you may attempt to learn a trait from them.
As an action, you attempt to learn the traits of a creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
Make a skill check, whose skill is dependant on the creature's type, and whose DC is dependant on the creature's tier.
On a success, you add the appropriate trait to your traits list.
Once you successfully learn a trait, you must finish a long rest before using this feature again.

At 6th, 11th, and 16th level, new classes of traits are available to you.

**Tier 1:** DC 13, must have 1 level in Blue Mage  
**Tier 2:** DC 15, must have 6 levels in Blue Mage  
**Tier 3:** DC 17, must have 11 levels in Blue Mage  
**Tier 4:** DC 19, must have 16 levels in Blue Mage  

**Aberration, Construct, Monstrosity, Ooze:** Arcana  
**Dragon, Giant, Humanoid:** History  
**Beast, Plant, Fey:** Nature  
**Celestial, Fiend, Elemental, Undead:** Religion  

## Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options.
You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Dueling

While you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other wapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.

## Lore Magic

Your arcane studies and familiarity with the extra-natural have given you facility with Spells.
See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of Spellcasting, and the end of this class description for your spell list.

### Spell Slots

The Blue Mage table shows how many spell slots you have.
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.
To cast one of your Blue Mage spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots.
To cast the 1st-level spell *Thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Blue Mage spell list.

You learn a new Blue Mage spell at certain levels outlined in the class level progression table.
A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new Blue Mage spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Blue Mage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Blue Mage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Blue Mage spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Blue Mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + Proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = Proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a Spellcasting focus for your Blue Mage spells.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase on ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Type Mimicry

Starting at 10th level, you learn to imitate the effect certain types of creature have on the Weave.
You may spend 10 minutes meditating on a creature type (e.g., *Aberration*, *Celestial*, etc.).
Henceforth, each creature of that type believes you to be of its own type.
Creatures immune to the Charm status effect are unaffected, but do not perceive that you are trying to charm them.

Traits are abilities learnt from other creatures.

# Other Thoughts

## General

Still need to come up with great feats for 14, and 18.

- Insight vs Intelligence contested check to opportunity attack the Blue Mage
- Can Charm creatures into thinking the Blue Mage is a creature of their type.
- Can communicate with creatures as if the Blue Mage were their type.
- Gets an opportunity attack against any creature that uses a feature (very tricky wording).
- Charm or Frighten monster as an action, Int mod times per day.
