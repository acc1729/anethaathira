### Sentient Greatsword

A magical greatsword, requiring a good alignment to wield.
This weapon is long and thin, giving off a subtle glow the hue of moonlight.
This weapon can be dismissed and re-summoned as an action, as if bound to the user.
Once per day, this weapon can create a blinding aura upon being summoned.
All creatures besides the wielder in a 20ft radius must pass a DC 15 CON save or be blinded for one minute, re-making the save at the start of each of their turns.
