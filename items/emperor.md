## Emperor
### Northern Regalia

Emperor has long since been sundered into two pieces -- colloquially known as Inevitability and Insurrection.

### Inevitability
#### Forsaken Greatsword

This onyx-black mass is one-half of Emperor.
A six-foot long behemoth of glass-like malevolence, this greatsword is currently in the possesion of Jahui.
