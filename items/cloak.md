## Scholar's Cloak
### Cursed Clothing

This item appears to be a white scholar's cloak from the outside, of a modern, sophisticated fashion. The inside of the shoulders, upper back, and upper arms are lined with living polyps and other tissue.  
When worn, the polyps attempt to dig through any other clothing worn on the character's back and fuse themselves directly to the character's back and upper arms. Once fused, the cloak can not be taken off except by removing the curse, combined with an excision in the next twenty-four hours.  
While worn, the cloak acts as a sensory organ. As a free action, the user can exchange their natural sight for Tremorsense 20ft, lasting a minute. Once during this time, the user can exchange 20ft of their normal movement speed on a turn for 10ft of burrowing speed. The user must wait ten minutes before using this ability again.  
!After becoming sufficiently attuned to the item, the cloak turns a light tan. The cloak's Tremorsense extends to 60ft when activated, and the user can no longer gain burrowing speed. Instead, once every thirty seconds, the user can blink 20ft in any direction, including to open spaces past solid walls. This movement still provokes opportunity attacks.  
!After becoming synchronized with this item, the cloak turns a dark red. The cloak's Tremorsense extends to 100ft, and the blink extends to 30ft. All creatures and objects between the start and end of the blink take 5d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage counts as Siege damage.
