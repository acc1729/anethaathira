## Shatter
### Sentient Greatsword

A magical greatsword, requiring 16 STR to wield. The metal the weapon is forged from appears as a glossy pewter. This weapon increases in power as its bond with the wielder increases. All damage this weapon does counts as bludgeoning Siege damage.  
This weapon can be dismissed and re-summoned as an action, as if bound to the user.  
!Once this weapon reaches +2, it can transform into any other weapon with the Heavy property. In addition, the wielder can use an action to make a single upwards swinging attack. On a hit, the target must succeed on a strength saving throw or be knocked 20ft away and fall prone. The DC is 8 + your STR modifier + profiency.  
!Once this weapon reaches +3, it can transform into any other non-Finesse weapon, with that weapon then gaining the Heavy property. As an action the wielder can evoke Shatter's natural will to destroy, charging the weapon with energy. While charged, the weapon gives off bright light in a 30ft radius, and dim light in a 30ft radius beyond that. The next melee weapon attack to succeed subjects the target to a 6th level Disintegrate spell, whose DC is 8 + your STR modifier + profiency.
