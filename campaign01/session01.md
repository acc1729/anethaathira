Cree, Malcolm, and Durzo all meet at the summer festival of a small town outside Placus.
Cree steals from some children, Malcolm does some magic tricks, and Durzo crafts for the chessmen of Ceretedefini.
The trio meet Thomas and go on a water walk with the townsfolk.
That night, they agree to help the guards, and fend off five zombies.
