The party did some research on Ballos, the Feywild, and Khaladna.
Malcolm got a fragment of his cloak stolen, and the party ran into Isaac.
Dismissing him as a doomsayer, they decided to board their vessel.

The captain announced the presence of a Saint aboard the boat after embarking.
The group enjoyed the calm waters south of Sigia for a few days.
About halfway through their journey, the party got to experience the avatar of Boreas descending from the clouds.
With high spirits on the ship from the sight of a god, the party and the crew enjoyed a few more weeks of sailing.

A dark and stormy day approached them, and the party geared up to help the sailors, except for Malcolm.
Malcolm was the first to notice that Captain Michael had been apprehended by Isaac.
The Druid commanded the party to disarm themselves, and for each act of non-compliance, he killed a member of the crew.
Eventually, the party submitted, and the Druid commanded the crew to unload the cargo onto the deck.
Having done so, they pulled out a box containing ossified remains, allegedly to-be-interred.

Isaac commanded them to crush the skeletons. After destroying one, the rest rose up and jumped over the railing into the ocean.
After a brief explanation, Isaac turned into a seagull and departed for the shore.

Later in Cache, the party met up with Isaac to discuss their plans and aspirations.
