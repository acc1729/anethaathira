Malcolm sent the group to Alamir's residing, and came upon the ship leading him and the Orcs to the coast of Cachia.
Once they landed, Malcolm convened with Darius, instructing him to prepare the wizard's college in Occidens to strike from behind.

Jeanette, Joshua, and Ellie all arrived as well to help push off Jahui's forces and clear the way for the trio.
