Having conquered the mad paladin and routed his forces, the party regrouped with Alamir.
Confirming their victory, Cree attuned herself with Inevitability, whose form became a gauntlet and a vambrace.
They walked through the burnt warzone and ascended the city-mountain to Occidens, where Cree and Malcolm met with Jack.
Having upheld his end of the bargain, Jack saw fit to bestow a boon upon the warlock.
Malcolm requested ceremorphosis, which the ulitharid provided.

Cree searched for Liam, discovering that he could not be contacted easily.
Jack Plane Shifted her to where his body was, and the monk carried his corpse back to Occidens from the field of war.

Durzo caroused the town, and set up a name for himself as the most-fortitudinous drinker Occidens had ever seen.
Several statues were raised in comemoration.

Finally, the three convened North with Isaac and Jizo.
Isaac was able to reincarnate Liam without any transformative side effects.
After, the thief recounted his assailant: An assassin in purple who saw through invisibility.
