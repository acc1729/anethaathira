The group charted a cab and a boat to Orientalum, the trip taking a few legs.
On land, they ran into Cap'n Sandbeard's crew, running a highwayman outfit.
Needless to say, the happenstance reunion went quite swimmingly.

Once in Orientalum, the party learnt of the fomenting tension between Orcishkind and the Humans.
Through some investigation, the group eventually came to side with the Orcs, with Malcolm posing as a messiah figure.

Of note, they learned of Deraj, a wyvern-riding warrior come to claim an item from the magic auction being held in Orientalum.
Additionally, all the planar Gates in Orientalum have been sealed off by the ruling merchant class, in an attempt to halt Deraj's arrival.
Malcolm gained a friend in Alamir, a wealthy elven merchant, who took a trip with him and offered some insight into the auction.
