Malcolm had a brief foray into the central catacombs of Texpan, discovering the empty tombs of the early Johnson family monarchs.
Immediately thereafter, the party rendezvoused in the forest near Texpan, attempting to find a fey crossing.
Some time later, the party found themselves face to face with the river, obverting themselves into the Feywild.

While Malcolm made a request to the River King for passage, Durzo fashioned a boat out of the trees nearby.
They met a werebear, Omar, who was seeking to set up his homestead in the periphery of Pantex -- The King of Bears, dying recently to the Texpan fires, left a void to claim.
After a brief run-in with the King of Moonlight, the party found they way to fey Cache, which manifested as an endless coastline in all four directions.
Among the lagoons, were a group of pirates looking for treasure.

Malcolm, of course, found his way into the treasure chest by nothing more than happenstance.
While Cree helped unearth the lad, Durzo made good with the pirate captain, and became wise to his faith in Gillast.
The party onboard the ship, with Durzo commanding a tide to lift it aloft, the pirates commenced a ritual offering to Gillast, whose grace brought them back to Cachia.

Secure in Cachia, Malcolm teleported the treasure to Darius in the city of Occidens, before teleporting himself as well.
Cree and Durzo found their way to the small town of Marpachi, where a young man's birthday was happening.
Orienting themselves towards Occidens, they made their way in-land.

Malcolm delivered himself to Jahui, where the awoken knight promptly battered him with Inevitability.
Teleporting out once again to his friends in a small town in Eastern Cachia, the party opted to find their way to Occidens for a re-group.
Malcolm sent Cree and Durzo first -- Durzo attempted to seek council with Jack, but was turned back.
Cree tried to threaten a guard into compliance, and had to flee in the library.
Malcolm once again teleported into Jahui's grasp, but managed to flee to Occidens once again.
