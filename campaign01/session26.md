Our party once again arranged an audience with the king of the Dwarves, who fulfilled his obligation to them.
They met with the appropriate clerks and managers of the Dwarven kingdom, and were soon set with enough platinum to buy a small village.
Of course, they also earned prime real estate in Texpan, second largest city in the Dwarven kingdom.

They all settled in during a month-long rebuilding process.
Cree went a found a teacher who could educate her in Lukian, which she learnt with ease.

Durzo spent his time Scrying on Jahui.
The mad Paladin could tell each time an invisible sensor appeared, and seemed driven to mad fits for each one.
Aside from that, he also contacted his sons and invited them to the new Blint family mansion.

Malcolm embarked on a journey to the underdark, exploring the old ruins of an illithid city.
He discovered it abandoned, with myconids trying to colonize.
Across the cityscape were odd statues of mindflayers, and at its apex was a calcified Elder Brain, brought low by some plague.
At the crest he found a scroll of Contact Outer Plane, which he used to communicate with Ballos and Melazkir.
Returning home, he stumbled upon Jizo and Isaac finishing their journey through the underdark, and brought them home to Texpan.
