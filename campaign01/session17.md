The party once more entered Chare, illuminated by the morning light.
They maintained their composure as the wary townsfolk, under spell from Jeremiah, kept their distance.
Arriving in the chapel, they listened to a sermon as the leader entered, and vanished beneath the floorboards when they weren't looking.

After persuading the other townsfolk to leave their post atop the trapdoor, the party descended into the caverns beneath Chare.
They found a chamber full of darkness, filled with townsfolk and the ominous chanting of Jeremiah.
The leader sacrificed the people in droves, bringing forth beings of darkness to face the party.
After a narrow brush with death, Cree successfully brought the cultist to his last breath.

The party fled the town post-haste, taking to the paved North-bound road toward Vienvillevain.
On the road they met the Black Dragon Sorceror, Elizabeth.
Malcolm and her had a polite discussion about the nature of one's roots, before Cree mentioned Julia.
The sorceress mentioned her disdain for the witch, before departing, leaving the party in a dispute over who to trust.
