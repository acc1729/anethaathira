### One-shot feature Ellie, Joshua, and Jeanette

Ellie and Jeanette, both seafarers, met in the port city of Iztacheca at the behest of some letters sent by Malcolm.
They both figured they had to go to Texpan, and set aside their relationship as merchant-and-pirate for the greater good.
Along the way, they picked up a straggler, Joshua, Knight of Ulorian.

Upon arriving in the burnt capitol of Tetaco, the group did some initial scouting.
They found the city in smouldering ruins, smoke still rising up off the ground, and embers falling from above.
A burning moth of Ballos circled the ruins, spreading ash and cintels with each shake of its wretched wings.
Braving onward into the city, it appeared that a coven of cultists were abjuring the moth against threat.

After dispatching one of the cultists, the abjuring ritual ended.
A black dragon dispatched the moth, allowing the party to advance towards the center.
All gates being locked off, they had to scale the high inner walls.
At the top, Julia, adorned with shining longsword and longbow, announced her presence, and commenced a battle to the end to prevent their advance.

Losing the fight to the combined force of the travels, her body lit to flames as the party tossed it over the wall.
Rising from the ashes was an incarnate of Ballos, equipped with deadly bow and blade.
In a bitter fight to the end, the three dispatched the demon.
Before descending into the inner cloister, the black dragon alighted and acknowledged the group, before heading West to recover.
They made towards the centre, and headed to the city of Firechannel.
