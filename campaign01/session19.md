After a conflict with a Roper holding position over a bridge, the exhausted group attempted to find somewhere to shelter.

The next night, Durzo found a secret hideout in the woods -- an abandoned shack.
Malcolm's alarm was tripped by a group of crows that had claimed the shack as a resting ground.
After some brief negotiations, they agreed to relinquish the fort for the night.

The next day, they traveled West, finding an old shrine to the Ordian monk.
