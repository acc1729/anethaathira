The party traveled from Siral to Firechannel over the morning.
Arriving in the late afternoon, Malcolm fetched a photograph of the entrance using Boris' Tiny Portrait.
Once inside, Durzo eventually found Alath, who took them on a trip through the statue garden before sharing her wisdom.
Alath sent them on their way, and the party investigated the undead plague, speaking with a deacon of Komra.
The party learned some of the history of Ballos.
They descended into the deep crypts of Firechannel, finding Saint Fath the Weaponsmith missing.
Similarly, the saint of armorsmithing's sarcophagus was opened, though the skeleton remained in place.
They found some recent activity in the weavers' catacombs, with many freshly-dispatched Dwarven undead littered with skeletons.
Malcolm found several Swan Feathers amongst the body, as well as Ordian scimitars the Crows had to abandon to hide.
They eventually took the Earthgate home to Texpan, meeting up with Liam in Moongate.
They decided to break-and-enter the vault in a noble's basement that same night.
The heist paid off with over a thousand gold, several gems, some scrolls and some tomes of lore.
