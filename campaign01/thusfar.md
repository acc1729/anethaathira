Durzo and Cree went downstairs to convince Gerald Thorns, the man whose house they broke into, to come upstairs.
He brought his guards with him, and when they tried to abduct them into the closet, a fight broke out.
One guard escaped and started screaming, so the party split and tried to run.
Durzo disguised himself as a guard and ran outside.
Malcolm tried to run downstairs, but an actual guard saw him.
He phased through the floor and hid in a coat closet in the basement for eight hours.

## Sunday, December 8th, 2019

Malcolm and Durzo were escorted through the beautiful spring-time city of Texpan, listening to the birds chirp and the streetcats play as they were escorted by the guards.
Cree followed shortly behind, keeping herself hidden.
Malcolm was the first to notice the deadening of the streetlife and the smoke South over the castle district.
Cree donned her captain's attire, acting out the role of the Captain of the Guard from the inner court district.
With their duties relieved, the guards made haste to the Promenade, where the smoke was rising higher and higher.
The party -- despite their conflicts with the guards -- ran alongside them, fearing for the worst from the fire.
The party descended into Zanteg's Promendade, fighting their way through the smoke and down onto the central Bazaar.
There, they saw the slave branded with Dangerous, amidst a growing pool of blood and slaughtered souls.
Durzo, wreathed in the souls of his ancestors, stepped forward to challenge the slave.
The slave gathered the souls of the recently slain, churning their spirits with the flames around him before stepping forward to face the party.
They promptly fled from the madman, letting the Orcs know no one was left to save.
Malcolm flew over the castle to find and save Boris.
From his vantage, he could see an army of crows ascending the city walls, before he dove into Boris' manor to speak with the wizard.

They rest for a moment, as a squadron of Crows ascended the inner wall.

## Sunday, December 15th, 2019

The group found a Tiefling named Cafla and joined him on a five-day journy to Northstar.
They shared many stories along the way, before being assailed by a hungry Lindwurm.
It bit Cree and she contracted Lindwurm Fever, but Malcolm warded it off.

They arrived in Northstar and went to meet the mayor, Lord Hartmann.
Upon finding their mayor into the central lighthouse, they sat for introductions with the man.
He offered a scrying service for them, seeing as Malcolm was set on spying on Darius.
They saw Darius suffocating two would-be assassins.
Cree wanted to see her sister, Ellie, and the mayor obliged.
Ellie had been pirating goods, which the Mayor was able to ascertain.
He recommended they keep better company before ushering them on their way.

The party briefly saw Garret, before visiting a doctor for Cree's illness.

About halfway through their journey, the party got to experience the avatar of Boreas descending from the clouds.
With high spirits on the ship from the sight of a god, the party and the crew enjoyed a few more weeks of sailing.

A dark and stormy day approached them, and the party geared up to help the sailors, except for Malcolm.
Malcolm was the first to notice that Captain Michael had been apprehended by Isaac.
The Druid commanded the party to disarm themselves, and for each act of non-compliance, he killed a member of the crew.
Eventually, the party submitted, and the Druid commanded the crew to unload the cargo onto the deck.
Having done so, they pulled out a box containing ossified remains, allegedly to-be-interred.

Isaac commanded them to crush the skeletons. After destroying one, the rest rose up and jumped over the railing into the ocean.
After a brief explanation, Isaac turned into a seagull and departed for the shore.

Later in Cache, the party met up with Isacc to discuss their plans and aspirations.
