The party embarked on their journey through the marshlands of North Coul.
Finding themselves without a boat, Durzo crafted one from a tree, through the will of Komra.
Malcolm happened to enlist the River King's fae servant, Every, in guiding their path.
The fae dragon steered them towards the stormhead where a fae crossing was, and once through precipace, to his master's castle.

Malcolm met with the River King, Ulorian, and was promoted to his sole knight.
Ulorian gave Malcolm his request -- salvation -- and showed the young man the wall of fire on the horizon.
Armed with knowledge and a newly struck fulgurite rod, the party exited the king's castle to head South.
