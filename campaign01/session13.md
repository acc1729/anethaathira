The party traveled a short distance to a city near Firechannel.
They traveled down and found the gate to the Plane of Ice, a colliseum with six upright pillars.
The pillars burst with energy, and the party found themselves standing in the cold.
Durzo found a bottle of Winterwash for sale -- A high-proof, mintor liquor.
Meanwhile, Cree and Malcolm bought the team a set of ice boots.
The group found a Tiefling named Cafla and joined him on a five-day journy to Northstar.
They shared many stories along the way, before being assailed by a hungry Lindwurm.
It bit Cree and she contracted Lindwurm Fever, but Malcolm warded it off.

They arrived in Northstar and went to meet the mayor, Lord Hartmann.
Upon finding their mayor into the central lighthouse, they sat for introductions with the man.
He offered a scrying service for them, seeing as Malcolm was set on spying on Darius.
They saw Darius suffocating two would-be assassins.
Cree wanted to see her sister, Ellie, and the mayor obliged.
Ellie had been pirating goods, which the Mayor was able to ascertain.
He recommended they keep better company before ushering them on their way.

The party briefly saw Garret, before visiting a doctor for Cree's illness.
She tried stealing from a noble, but was caught due to her coughing.
She paid a fine to be released, and then the party departed through Icegate, winding up in Sigia.
