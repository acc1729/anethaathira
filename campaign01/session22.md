The party set out into the Southern part of Give, where all the merchants, guild leaders, and officials lived.
They approached the house of Gunther at dawn, executing a well coordinated assault on the premises.
Malcolm sauntered through the kitchen, busy with breakfast making, while Cree entered through a window.
Durzo led a distraction at the gate, before the three rushed in from all angles.
The ensuing chaos ended with a tiger running out into town, the kitchen chefs disparaged, and Gunther deposed in a duel.
The group left satisfied, stumbling across Cafla's shop on their back to base.
Malcolm bought some fine inks, as well as some mint liquer, from the Tiefling.

The group made for The Sunken Labyrinth, descending through the facade of a church of Gillast.
The party deftly navigated the traps of the Labyrinth, coming to the end only a few scrolls lighter than the start.
Entering the foyer of The Sunken Labyrinth, the group was met by a tall woman by the name of Linda, acting as bouncer.
After spending a leisurely while wandering the establishment, fitted with a singing harpy in caged in the centre, the party met with the bar owner, Garrison.
Malcolm opted to sneak into the back room, which Linda spotted.
In the fight that followed, the party subdued Linda, a weretiger, and forced Garrison, a werewolf, to flee.
They tracked Garrison to his home outside of town, and forced him into giving Cree the curse of Lycanthropy.
