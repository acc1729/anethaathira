Having been rebuked by Momentum several times in the ethereal, the party resorted to sly tricks to gain his powers.
Durzo coated himself in a healthy serving of Sovereign Glue and went to the ethereal to wrestle with Momentum.
Having lost the contest, the ethereal Tiefling found himself stuck to the stour Human.
Upon returning to the material, Durzo found himself in possession of Momentum, who divulged the king's personal given title: Avalanche.

The group made their way to the Feywild with Jamichael, where they quite easily found the River King.
The magnate led them to where an enormous dinosaur resided, and took bets from the group, as well as from a few gods.
With a few bits of light interference from beyond, it ended up that Jamichael won the saurians tail, and they headed off to the material once again.
