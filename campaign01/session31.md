The party said their farewells to Alamir, the elf from Orientalum.
Durzo gave him the task of rallying Orcish troops to lead a charge against Jahui.
The elf set off amidst the chaos of the Orcish rioting in Orientalum.

The party made their way across the bridge that circumscribes the world.
Heading West, they quickly made their way over the Western half of Argenia.
Along the way, Cree shifted into a werewolf and destroyed a small bridge hamlet, including an orphanage.

The group got over the mainland of Anethena, and observed that all the lifts down into Argenia had been broken.
With some resourcefulness, they dropped down onto the bridge-shadowed down to Hasbegen, and trekked North to Tien.
