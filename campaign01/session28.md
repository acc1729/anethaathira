Malcolm had a dream of Thomas helping the group travel to Texpan.
In the dream, Salta could plainly see Patience sitting next to Thomas.

As the party was planning their next move, a ring of Thomas' spies ambushed Cree.
They fought them off and ensured Cree's safety, before causing a scene with the city guard and a local homeowner.
A few days later, they ran into the famous Tark, running his Imperial Fabrics traveling shop in Occidens.
They mailed him to Jahui after dealing with the annoyance, before deciding to move on.

Durzo set off to spend a few nights with Thomas at camp; Thomas shared a rumor of the light-scaled dragon of North Argenia.
Malcolm and Cree went to Texpan to cash a bad check from Tark, and Laris tracked them down to formally invite them to a dinner.
Affairs settled, they all met up in a remote location in Ordia to question Thomas.

The assassin was not very receptive to this line of attack, and promptly shut down Cree's attempt at intimidation.
Once Malcolm began casting Blink, Thomas sprung into action and lunged at him with Patience, before escaping into the jungle.

Having exhausted that avenue of information, the party regrouped in Firechannel to enjoy a feast.
Laris offered a toast to the party's great accomplishment, before departing to meditate in the Black Depths, leaving Lauv in charge of the kingdom.
