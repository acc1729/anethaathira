The party had an enjoyable evening walk in the Feywild town of Pantex.
They met the Dwarven farmer Tsiru while he was reading in the park.
He invited them back for mushroom stew at his house, which most of the town attended.
They agreed to take Trisu and his Lizardfolk friend Rashar back to the Plane of Earth.
They set off towards the Fey mountain of Teteco, which they climbed over the course of several days.
Dropping off their friends in a system of caves, the party descended the other side, before deciding to ascend once more and enter the caves.
They killed a Redcap, and eventually made their way into the Plane of Earth.
After dispatching a group of undead in a stone hallway, the party traveled another few days until coming upon a Dwarven garrison.
They ascended from the crypts into the Dwarven city of Siral, and planned to travel to Firechannel soon after.
