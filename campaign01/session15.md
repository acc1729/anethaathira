The squad moved out Northeast, taking out an Ogre and a few Gelatinous Cubes on their path.
They arrived in the shanty town surrounding the ground-level of Ultimum Occidens, with Cree taking it upon herself to end a pauper's life.
Partway through a night discussing fate atop of a ramshackle inn, they saw a lift from Occidens lower down onto a city square, and paid the fair to ascend.

The lift took them three miles into the sky, onto the bridge just West of Occidens, where they slept the night.
They approached the wall of the city proper, entering the labyrinthian streets of the man-made mountain city.
Malcolm made his way towards the zenith, seeking the Mage's College.
He approached, demanding the presense of the strongest mage there-in, before going invisible and phasing through the wall.
Malcolm flew through the ceiling and into the library Demiplane of Occidens, finding a book on Coul's fey as well as Effective Communication by Zharka.
Darius, having mastered Khaladna's Truesight, was able to pick him out as he flew down through the floor and into the bazaar.

Meanwhile, Cree was caught stealing and sentenced to a buraeucratic hell, before eventually sneaking out and resting on a rooftop.
The witch of Ballos, Julia, climbed up to meet her, commissioning her to slaughter the cultist Jeremiah in Chare.

Malcolm later met up with Durzo, and the two turned in the Ogre's head when the bard Adelaide happened upon them.
She implored them to stop the cult in Chare, claiming her family to be in danger.
They all coalesced after Malcolm had a chat with Darius about his research, agreeing to set out the next day.
