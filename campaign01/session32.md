In Tien, the group set off doing their usual bid.
The party met Michael at the hunter's lodge in town, who told them some rumors of the dragon to the West.
Somewhat unsatisfied with his answers, they took off -- Malcolm and Cree to the shops, Durzo to the forge.
Durzo helped Zane and his apprentice with some shopwork, repairing a damaged shield owned by Reynauld, a Paladin hunting were-creatures.

They made their way to the tavern, alive with the evening's revelry.
At some point, a fellow Paladin approached Durzo, inquiring to any sightings of werewolves or weretigers.
The hunter saw through Durzo's lie.
Particularly, Durzo knowing about the orphanage slaughter and ending up so quickly in Tien, despite Argenia's border lockdown.

The group slept soundly that night, and set off the following morning.
They met Reynauld gearing up for reconaissance, and he traded information on the dragon.
Particularly, the drake they were hunting must be a very old White Dragon, alive when Khaladna was helping the ancient king of Ordia conquer the land.
In addition, their Paladin order had some information on the ancient Ordian dagger the party had long since obtained.

With that, they set into the wilderness Westward.
