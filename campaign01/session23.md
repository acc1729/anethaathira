Meeting up with Cafla in the market square once more, the group left for their hotal.
On the way there, a homeless man by the name of Joshua happened to see Durzo using disguise magic.
The man beseeched them during the night, offering his service in return for power.
Malcolm tricked him into seeking out the River King, Ulorian.

The next morning, the party traveled with Cafla across the Sea of Anethena to Ice Gate.
They met up with Brightlord Enhart once more, offering him novelties in return for scrying.
He was able to show them the goings-on of Durzo's wife and Cree's sister, but not of the Cleric of Ballos.

Throughout their travel, they sent a variety of messages to friend and foe alike, orchestrating a conflux of personalities centred on Texpan.
