Having had met his patron and receiving his knighthood, Malcolm disembarked from the Faewild once again.
Cree Nightshade's task came to the fore -- seek out Lycanthrophy in the city of Give, capitol of Coul.
They traveled along the coast of Lake Coul, taking a raft out towards the centre, before finding a merchant's galleon heading South.
Durzo blint negotiated passage with them, and the crew were off to Give through a main river South.

After having arrived, the group established a base of operations in an inconspicuous hotel.
Cree, harkening back to her days before adventure, slummed around in the local bars around the river Give was set upon.
A nameless drunkard in a nameless bar gave her the tipoff -- The Sunken Labyrinth was an establishment patronized only by the upper crust of society.
Taking to the streets, the crew found a homeless gentleman, ex-slave of a local merchant named Gunther.
They retired to the inn, with a plan set to capture Gunther.
