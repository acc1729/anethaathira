Malcolm and Durzo were escorted through the beautiful spring-time city of Texpan, listening to the birds chirp and the streetcats play as they were escorted by the guards.
Cree followed shortly behind, keeping herself hidden.
Malcolm was the first to notice the deadening of the streetlife and the smoke South over the castle district.
Cree donned her captain's attire, acting out the role of the Captain of the Guard from the inner court district.
With their duties relieved, the guards made haste to the Promenade, where the smoke was rising higher and higher.
The party -- despite their conflicts with the guards -- ran alongside them, fearing for the worst from the fire.
The party descended into Zanteg's Promendade, fighting their way through the smoke and down onto the central Bazaar.
There, they saw the slave branded with Dangerous, amidst a growing pool of blood and slaughtered souls.
Durzo, wreathed in the souls of his ancestors, stepped forward to challenge the slave.
The slave gathered the souls of the recently slain, churning their spirits with the flames around him before stepping forward to face the party.
They promptly fled from the madman, letting the Orcs know no one was left to save.
Malcolm flew over the castle to find and save Boris.
From his vantage, he could see an army of crows ascending the city walls, before he dove into Boris' manor to speak with the wizard.
Boris agreed to come with him, and the duo flew to the top of the inner walls before Malcolm's flight wore off.
They rest for a moment, as a squadron of Crows ascended the inner wall.
Malcolm and Boris met the High Wizard of Ordia, Khaladna, though neither realized that he was a long dead figure.
They all converged on the castle proper, meeting together with King Johnson and his court wizard Carl.
They scryed upon the slave, seeing his risen reavers before deciding the abandon the city.
They escorted the royal retinue to the Earthgate, where the Dwarves were flooding in from.
King Johnson and Scott both met Laris, the King of Dwarves on the other side, and a very informal succession was had.
The party rested once more in Firechannel, preparing for the rest of their journey.
