The trio read a dossier on King Johnson and Karst Jahui.
Malcolm met with Boris to talk about travels, and was taught the spell Silence.
Durzo went and made a sword, and later harassed a dangerous-branded slave.
Cree broke into a noble's house and stole a bunch of letters.
The party met up with Liam for one last planning session before raiding the auction.
Malcolm turned Durzo invisible and they all snuck into the auction house.
They immediately ran into a utility closet upstairs, hiding.
Durzo and Cree went downstairs to convince Gerald Thorns, the man whose house they broke into, to come upstairs.
He brought his guards with him, and when they tried to abduct them into the closet, a fight broke out.
One guard escaped and started screaming, so the party split and tried to run.
Durzo disguised himself as a guard and ran outside.
Malcolm tried to run downstairs, but an actual guard saw him.
He phased through the floor and hid in a coat closet in the basement for eight hours.
Cree -- diguised as Gerald Thorns -- ran down the hall and cried for help.
The host of the event pulled her into the safety of his room, and fetched Thorns' guards for her.
She eventually convinced them to escort her home, where she promptly escaped out a back window.
Meanwhile, Liam was invisible in a corner of the house during the commotion. He made out with a pair of sending stones.
After the party regrouped in Moongate, they decided to leave
Durzo went to fetch the cart, but found that the cart had been impounded by the city watch.
Malcolm joined Durzo in being arrested.
