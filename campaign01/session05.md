The party moved into Tetaco, with Cree teaching Malcolm and Durzo the basics of Nacalcan.
They kept moving southward towards the capitol, Texpan.
Early on, they had to cross a desert with their horses and carriage.
Along the way, they encountered a small oasis at high noon.
Malcolm climbed a palm tree in the centre of it, and ended up in the Feywild.
He rose from the top to see an endless desert.
At the apex were the palm fronds and massive fruits.
He met the ill-omen malphus, Murder, who was on his way to the Plane of Fire.
That night, Cree noticed a Crow emissary leave a note and a reward for slaying the necromancer.
Traveling into mainland Tetaco, the party found a city to gather supplies before heading further in.
