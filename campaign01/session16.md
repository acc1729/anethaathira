Before they were able to depart from Occidens, the local constable stopped by the group.
One of the sheriffs informed Malcolm that he had an audience with the King, requested by the Warlock himself.
With some apprehension, the party accompanied him zenith-bound, before reaching the castle gate.
Malcolm proceeded alone, making his way into the audience chamber.

The King of Silence, Jack, greeted him and laid out his request.
Karst Jahui, Iron Branch of Tetaco, was bound for a similar fate as Malcolm, a warlock and conduit for power.
The warrior's mind was too frail, and he was left with an oath to eradicate the abberant.
Jack offered a deal: Stop Jahui's campaign across Anethaathira, in return for further power and knowledge.

Malcolm left, and the party descended from the Western Mountain, traveling Northwest to Chare.
Once there, they started a ham-fisted investigation into the cult's goings-on, without revealing too much.
After harassing the local chapel's housewomen, they went to sleep at an inn, where they were assailed by a being of darkness.
Fending off the shade, they escaped the town into the night, where they waited three days, planning to strike once more.
