## Sunday, September 29th
The party listened to the local crier, learning of highwaymen between Texpan and Psych.
Additionally, the heard about a fallen shrine discovered on the way to Texpan.
Finally, they hear of the magic item auction happening in the capitol.
They set out, running into the highwaymen fairly fast.
Cree talked with them, and negotiated passage for several silver, while Malcolm tried to get himself killed.
On the road South, they parked their wagon and horses to go wander into the woods.
They traveled several hours into the shrine, descending into it and discovering the tomb of an old saint.
Inside, Durzo found a secret door that was only openable from one side.
Malcolm blasted the stone lid off of the coffin, and after a short while found the Scholar's Robe hiding around.
At this moment, their investigation was interrupted by and undead assault.
One illithid, split into skin, muscles, and nervous tissue, each re-animated, fought the party.
After they won, Malcolm put on the robe, which promptly attuned itself to him.
He passed through the stone door, opened it, and led the party down into the caves.
They found themselves on the outskirts of an abandoned Mindflayer city, and traveled across a blue lake.
