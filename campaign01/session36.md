The party, having cleared the dungeon, took their time exploring the rest of it.
They descended the grand tower into the royal quarters, where they found a Salve of Minification and some Sovereign Glue.

They moved into the Library to do some further research on any help with the blight.
Instead, they discovered some insights onto the nature of magic items: there were two kinds.
The first coalesced directly from the soul in an ivory moonlit ritual.
The second built in a construct from a specific stone and gold.

Durzo found and imp named Imp whom Khaladna had long since captured in a warded cage.
Durzo commissioned Malcolm as his lawyer, and negotiated a deal with the imp, granting him an invocation.
Cree took to the rooftop to steal an Arctic Owlbear egg for herself.

With that done, the party sent a letter to Khaladna telling them about the imp.
In a fit of rage, the wizard let slip the secret of Momentum.
The party then claimed to have broken the ancient artifact.

This ended with the party learning the late king's secret, and ascending once more to try to negotiate with Momentum in the ethereal.
