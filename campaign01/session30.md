The party joined the Orientalum magic auction, accompanied by Alamir.
They were able to buy a few things, such as some Beads of Force, and a Potion of Storm Giant Strength.
Alamir offered to buy them something, and Malcolm chose for it to be the Headband of Intellect.
The final offering, selling for five-hundred thousand gold, was the legendary greatsword Shatter.

Deraj's great wyvern Fulgurite burst through the ceiling into the main theatre shortly after the announcement.
A horrid affair ensued, with Deraj's Edict cutting through the bodyguards and tellers while the wyvern fended off the rest of the crowd.
Sentinels through the second floor balcony focused on suppressing Malcolm and Durzo.
The pair of Malcolm and Cree ended up escaping to the second floor to take care of the sentinel mages.
On the ground, Durzo found himself surrounded by hired guards, fending off their blows.

When Malcolm and Cree were finally able to subdue the last sentinel, Durzo's Animate Objects annihilated the swarm of guardsmen around him.
All that was left of the fight was a mist of blood as the group reigned victorious.
Deraj sat to catch his breath, and acknowledged the group's help in his victory.
He claimed Shatter for the orcs, and left once again.
