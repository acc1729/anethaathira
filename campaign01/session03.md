The trio went into town and spoke with the mayor, Alfred.
He seemed concerned about something, but not what the party was concerned about.
They introduced themselves and then left, meeting Vilmiers and Shasha.
Instead of sleeping, they investigated the graveyard, and then further into the woods.
They turned back after facing an ambush of undead.
Back in town the next day, they spoke with Shasha and then the mayor about the murdered guard.
They teamed up with Shasha in the cemetary and got moving, delving back into the wood.
They were ambushed at night by a necromancer and his ghouls, but survived.
They went deeper into the woods, heading East across a river before finding the Necromancer's hideout.
