Cree, Durzo, and Malcolm made their way from Icegate to Firechannel, statues of ancient Dwarven heroes lording over the entrance.
Inside, they found audience with Laris.
Durzo tried to inform the king of goings-on in the Prime Material Plane, which the king seemed to brush off.
In the audience chamber, the party successfully requested two agate, two-hundred platinum, immunity from petty charges, and a grand residence in Texpan.
The stipulation, of course, was that the party would have to liberate Texpan first.

The king of Dwarves organized a raiding party, and our heroes traveled Earthgate with two battalions.
The Dwarves set up a defense perimeter and cleared the way for the party to advance.
They braved the burning ruins of Texpan, charging past hoards of undead and cultish horrors.
Finding Ballos' pool of blood, once proud Zanteg's Promenade, the part descended into the smokescreened pit.

At it's centre, they found the Cleric of Ballos, steeped in a lake of burning blood.
After a grand battle of controlling the tides of blood, the enemy was dispatched, exploding into a rain of blood.
The party liaisoned with Liam on the outskirts of town, meeting Adelaide and Shasha.
All six returned to the center of Texpan, to discuss their next priorities and say farewells.
