#House Rules
* Warlocks may, at character creation, opt to use INT instead of CHA for all warlock feats and attributes.
* Casters may request to use a leveled spell for something other than its written purpose. They must expend the slot and then pass a DC 15 Arcana check to do so, at the DM's discretion.
* Spell scrolls have no caster requirements. You must provide components as usual, however.
* At your first ASI, you may take both an ASI and a feat from a selected list, provided below. If the feat provides its own ASI normally, you do not benefit from it.
* Inspiration may be used to re-roll any d20 roll, at your discretion.
* Skill checks may use any relevant attribute at the DM's discretion.
* Dying creatures are dropped to 5ft movement and may speak falteringly.
* Drinking a potion costs a bonus action, feeding someone a potion costs an action.
* You may remove armor in half the usual doff time when necessary. Removing it quickly damages it, making it lose 1 AC until repaired.

##Water Rules
* Non-piercing weapon attacks are made at disadvantage.
* No languages other than Aquan can be spoken underwater.
* Somatic components can not be provided underwater.
* Treading water requires a DC 10 Athletics (Constitution) check. The DC becomes 15 if wearing Medium Armor, and 20 if wearing Heavy Armor.

##Breath Rules
* In non-strenuous situations, characters can hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to their CON score times 30.
* In strenuous situations, a character can hold their breath for 2 times their CON mod rounds, minimum 1.
* When a character is out of breath, they make a DC 10 CON save or begin dying. The save DC increases by 1 for every turn they can't regain their breath. 
* If a caster is holding their breath, they may provide the verbal components for one spell, losing their breath in the process.
* Anytime a character holding their breath takes damage, they make a Concentration check to maintain their breath.

###Free Feats

* Linguist
