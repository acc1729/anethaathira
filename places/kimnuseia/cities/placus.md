## Placus
Placus is a small city located in central Kimnuseia.
Far away from any major tributaries, the town's trade suffers heavily, but arable land is plentiful.
The area around Placus is mainly forest or grassland, and the region experiences the seasons four-fold.
The mayor -- Alfred -- mostly cares about keeping the town safe, and the high presence of standing guards does a good job maintaining order.
A secondary concern for the mayor is the approaching army of Karst Jahui.
The mayor expects to be the first major city annexed by the general, and is preparing for a full surrender.
Of note, no less-than-legal organizations take root in the town.
The city does have a handful of spell-casters, who charge a comparatively exorbitant price for their services.
In addition, scholars of Ceretedefini look after a library near the town center, and offer education.
Besides Ceretedefini, the only other deity worshipped en-masse is Boreas, whom the locals host a three day long celebration for at the advent of summer.
Placus has an issue with a necromancer who resides in an abandoned dwelling near a town to the east of the main city.
The necromancer has exhumed several graveyards in the area. Avoiding the main guarded cemetaries, he agitates the dead and has a semblance of control over them.
A small platoon of three Crows haunt the area, dispatching small bands of agitated dead while making their presence unknown.
