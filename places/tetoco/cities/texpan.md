## Texpan
Texpan is the capitol of the second largest country in Anethaathira, and the largest on the continent of Arithira.
The city hosts several hundred thousand denizens, and has one of the highest populations of outlanders amongst all capitol cities.
The city's colors are dark green and silver.
Its blazon is an image of a gryphon.
The city is home to a gate leading to the Plane of Earth.
Access is highly restricted, and expensive enough to preclude most commoners.
As such, worship of Komra is highly visible.
In addition, the city hosts a magical item auction once every few years, on an invitation-basis.
