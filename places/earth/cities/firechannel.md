## Firechannel, the Mountainhome
Firechannel is the pride of the Dwarven people, and the seat of the King of Dwarves, Laris.
Firechannel holds all the timeless treasures of dwarvenkind, including a dragon's egg.
It is home to Earthgate as well, which connects it directly to Texpan and Teteco writ large.
The living complex is connected to a vast cavern, which has been claimed as a center for the arts in Dwarven society.
The entrance from the mountain to Firechannel hosts several thirty-foot tall statues carved into the basalt, immortalizing the founders.
Likot and Alath, the miners; Ablel, the carpenter; Zasit, the mason; Erush and Amost, the farmers; and Fath the metalworker.
All seven of them have been skeletonized and buried deep in the crypts of Firechannel.
Justice is realized through the use of Hammerers. Survival is complete exhoneration.
