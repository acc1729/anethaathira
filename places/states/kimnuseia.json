        "With scant access to the coast, save for a network of rivers in the north east, most Kimnuseian traders travel by land. One of the largest countries by size alone, governance is uncentralized, with most towns sharing a common culture, both socially and politically.",
        "!Thanks to its lack of central control, many cities and towns operate independently. As a result, the military cannot influence affairs far inland, leading to instability along the Kimnuseia-Tetaco border. In particular, Karst has been aggressively campaigning north of the border."
