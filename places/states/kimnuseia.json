        "With scant access to the western coast, save for a network of rivers in the north east, most Kimnuseian traders travel by land. One of the largest countries by size alone, governance is uncentralized, with most towns sharing a common culture, both socially and politically.",
        "Aquilonis Finis resides on the border between Argenia and Kimnuseia. Thanks to its great height, it remains mostly independant from both countries, though they still vie for control over the base of the mountain.",
        "!Thanks to its lack of central control, many cities and towns operate independently. As a result, the military cannot influence affairs far inland, leading to instability along the Kimnuseia-Tetaco border. In particular, Karst has been aggressively campaigning north of the border."
