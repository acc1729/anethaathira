# Countries of Anethaathira

## Argenia

### Common languages: Argenian
### Present biomes: Tiaga, Tundra, Temperate Forest, Coasts



## Breya

### Common languages: Kimnuseian, Lainonian
### Present biomes: Coastal, Grassland, Temperate Forests

Breya is a fairly ordinary country. The powers that be are concerned with the situation in Tetaco, but don't have many worries aside from that.  s
!Shipping is often difficult thanks to the bridge. As a result, Breyan sailors are reknowned for their skill in piloting sea vessels.

## Kimnuseia

### Common languages: Kimnuseian, Argenian
### Present biomes: Grassland, Temperate Forest, Savanna, Deserts

With scant access to the coast, save for a network of rivers in the north east, most Kimnuseian traders travel by land. One of the largest countries by size alone, governance is uncentralized, with most towns sharing a common culture, both socially and politically.  s
!Thanks to its lack of central control, many cities and towns operate independently. As a result, the military cannot influence affairs far inland, leading to instability along the Kimnuseia-Tetaco border. In particular, Karst has been aggressively campaigning north of the border.

## Nacalco

### Common languages: Nacalcan, Aquan
### Present biomes: Savanna, Grassland, Temperate Forest, Coasts

A coastal country. Tetaco broke off from Nacalco, and still speaks Nacalcan as a result. Trades heavily with Ordia and Yatinia due to its coastal situation.  s
!Currently poltically stable. Situated far away from the bridges and the termini, though is worried about the instability in Tetaco.

## Tetaco

### Common languages: Nacalcans, Ignan
### Present biomes: Mountain, Tundra, Desert, Savanna, Grasslands

The second largest nation, ahead of Kimnuseia but behind Ordia. The capital city Texpan sits high atop a mountain, overlooking the vast plains and deserts of central Tetaco. Just as Kimnuseia, the sheer size of the country makes it hard to manage, but it retains a firmer control over its borders than its northern neighbor.  s
!Texpan finds itself vexed by the emergence of Karst Jahui. While the fierce warrior rampages through northern Tetaco, the current administration fears that he might secede or otherwise fail to obey their desires. A force has been sent marching northward in an attempt to envoy with Karst.
