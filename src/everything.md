## Countries of Anethaathira

### Argenia

#### Common languages: Argenian
#### Present biomes: Tiaga, Tundra, Temperate Forest, Coast

A very economically powerful state, Argenia is one of the only countries to have land on both continents. In addition, they own several islands within the Argenian seas, giving them massive control over trade routes.

### Breya

#### Common languages: Kimnuseian, Lainonian
#### Present biomes: Coastal, Grassland, Temperate Forest

Breya is a fairly ordinary country. The powers that be are concerned with the situation in Tetaco, but don't have many worries aside from that.  
!Shipping is often difficult thanks to the bridge. As a result, Breyan sailors are reknowned for their skill in piloting sea vessels.

### Kimnuseia

#### Common languages: Kimnuseian, Argenian
#### Present biomes: Grassland, Temperate Forest, Savanna, Desert

With scant access to the western coast, save for a network of rivers in the north east, most Kimnuseian traders travel by land. One of the largest countries by size alone, governance is uncentralized, with most towns sharing a common culture, both socially and politically.  
Aquilonis Finis resides on the border between Argenia and Kimnuseia. Thanks to its great height, it remains mostly independant from both countries, though they still vie for control over the base of the mountain.  
!Thanks to its lack of central control, many cities and towns operate independently. As a result, the military cannot influence affairs far inland, leading to instability along the Kimnuseia-Tetaco border. In particular, Karst has been aggressively campaigning north of the border.

### Lainonia

#### Common languages: Lainonian
#### Present biomes: Coast

Lainonia competes with Breya for economic trade. The bridge cuts right through the country, revealing the northern coast for free passage without worry.  
The country shares much of its culture with its Southern neighbor, Lukia. Trade is frequent between the two countries, and they are both in accord with Finem Orientalum.

### Lukia

#### Common languages: Lukian
#### Present biomes: Coast, Temperate Forest

Lukia and Lainonia are very closely related culturally. The nations have a treaty over the eastern coast of the continent, and share many trade routes.

### Nacalco

#### Common languages: Nacalcan, Aquan
#### Present biomes: Savanna, Grassland, Temperate Forest, Coast

A coastal country. Tetaco broke off from Nacalco, and still speaks Nacalcan as a result. Trades heavily with Ordia and Yatinia due to its coastal situation.  
!Currently poltically stable. Situated far away from the bridges and the termini, though is worried about the instability in Tetaco.

### Tetaco

#### Common languages: Nacalcans, Ignan
#### Present biomes: Mountain, Tundra, Desert, Savanna, Grassland

The second largest nation, ahead of Kimnuseia but behind Ordia. The capital city Texpan sits high atop a mountain, overlooking the vast plains and deserts of central Tetaco. Just as Kimnuseia, the sheer size of the country makes it hard to manage, but it retains a firmer control over its borders than its northern neighbor.  
!Texpan finds itself vexed by the emergence of Karst Jahui. While the fierce warrior rampages through northern Tetaco, the current administration fears that he might secede or otherwise fail to obey their desires. A force has been sent marching northward in an attempt to envoy with Karst.

### Tsiuc

#### Common languages: Lukian
#### Present biomes: Coast, Mountains, Temperate Forest

There, they saw the slave branded with Dangerous, amidst a growing pool of blood and slaughtered souls.
Durzo, wreathed in the souls of his ancestors, stepped forward to challenge the slave.
The slave gathered the souls of the recently slain, churning their spirits with the flames around him before stepping forward to face the party.
They promptly fled from the madman, letting the Orcs know no one was left to save.
Malcolm flew over the castle to find and save Boris.

Boris agreed to come with him, and the duo flew to the top of the inner walls before Malcolm's flight wore off.
They rest for a moment, as a squadron of Crows ascended the inner wall.
Malcolm and Boris met the High Wizard of Ordia, Khaladna, though neither realized that he was a long dead figure.

They traveled down and found the gate to the Plane of Ice, a colliseum with six upright pillars.
The pillars burst with energy, and the party found themselves standing in the cold.
Durzo found a bottle of Winterwash for sale -- A high-proof, mintor liquor.
Meanwhile, Cree and Malcolm bought the team a set of ice boots.

They shared many stories along the way, before being assailed by a hungry Lindwurm.
It bit Cree and she contracted Lindwurm Fever, but Malcolm warded it off.

They arrived in Northstar and went to meet the mayor, Lord Hartmann.
Upon finding their mayor into the central lighthouse, they sat for introductions with the man.
He offered a scrying service for them, seeing as Malcolm was set on spying on Darius.
They saw Darius suffocating two would-be assassins.
Cree wanted to see her sister, Ellie, and the mayor obliged.
Ellie had been pirating goods, which the Mayor was able to ascertain.
He recommended they keep better company before ushering them on their way.

About halfway through their journey, the party got to experience the avatar of Boreas descending from the clouds.
With high spirits on the ship from the sight of a god, the party and the crew enjoyed a few more weeks of sailing.

A dark and stormy day approached them, and the party geared up to help the sailors, except for Malcolm.
Malcolm was the first to notice that Captain Michael had been apprehended by Isaac.
The Druid commanded the party to disarm themselves, and for each act of non-compliance, he killed a member of the crew.
Eventually, the party submitted, and the Druid commanded the crew to unload the cargo onto the deck.
Having done so, they pulled out a box containing ossified remains, allegedly to-be-interred.

Isaac commanded them to crush the skeletons. After destroying one, the rest rose up and jumped over the railing into the ocean.
After a brief explanation, Isaac turned into a seagull and departed for the shore.

Later in Cache, the party met up with Isacc to discuss their plans and aspirations.

They immediately ran into a utility closet upstairs, hiding.
Durzo and Cree went downstairs to convince Gerald Thorns, the man whose house they broke into, to come upstairs.
He brought his guards with him, and when they tried to abduct them into the closet, a fight broke out.
One guard escaped and started screaming, so the party split and tried to run.
Durzo disguised himself as a guard and ran outside.
Malcolm tried to run downstairs, but an actual guard saw him.
He phased through the floor and hid in a coat closet in the basement for eight hours.
Cree -- diguised as Gerald Thorns -- ran down the hall and cried for help.
The host of the event pulled her into the safety of his room, and fetched Thorns' guards for her.

### Sunday, December 8th, 2019

Malcolm and Durzo were escorted through the beautiful spring-time city of Texpan, listening to the birds chirp and the streetcats play as they were escorted by the guards.
Cree followed shortly behind, keeping herself hidden.
Malcolm was the first to notice the deadening of the streetlife and the smoke South over the castle district.
Cree donned her captain's attire, acting out the role of the Captain of the Guard from the inner court district.
With their duties relieved, the guards made haste to the Promenade, where the smoke was rising higher and higher.
The party -- despite their conflicts with the guards -- ran alongside them, fearing for the worst from the fire.
The party descended into Zanteg's Promendade, fighting their way through the smoke and down onto the central Bazaar.
There, they saw the slave branded with Dangerous, amidst a growing pool of blood and slaughtered souls.
