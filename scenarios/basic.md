## Undead Party
### Levels 1-5
A town is hosting a festival for the local region. It is a three-day long affair, with many games, shows, and food to go around.
The festival is held out in the forest to celebrate the gods of the forest, rivers, and nature.
The festival is waylaid by a small group of zombies, which the party helps to clear out and subdue. Soon after, another wave of restless dead come upon the merry-makers. Starting to become something of a problem, the festival ends early as the townsfolk try to get back to the village.
Undead keep rising up, which the party must fend off. A few commoners are armed enough to hold their own, but there are too many to face alone.
Once the villagers manage to come back to the town and set up their defenses, they gather their funds to pay the party to find the source of the scourge.
Hiding out in a cave in the forest, an estranged necromancer works alone to raise and disturb the restless spirits into zombies. Motivated by hatred from the city rejecting his magical prowess, he mindlessly works towards their destruction.
The party enters the cave, dispatches him, and returns to the village to share the news.

Possible characters: Thomas, a squad of Crows
